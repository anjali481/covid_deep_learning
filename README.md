# COVID19 DETECTION USING CHEST XRAY IMAGES 

Here , we present VGG19 based implementation to identify COVID19 cases from X-Ray images .The model takes input as chest X-Ray images and outputs the probability as Positive or Negative.
The proposed model is developed to provide accurate diagnostics for binary classification with 98% accuracy.
